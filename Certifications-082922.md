    Passing both the CompTIA Security+ and Network+ exams and gaining the certifications has been incredible. Just two short months ago, I had no IT certifications but I had passion. IT and specifically cybersecurity have been my passions for as long as I can remember. To get two highly respected certifications in the span of about 45 days has been an amazing journey and one that I will continue to pursue. There's more on the horizon and I can't be more excited.
