## TCM Security 08.30.22 ##

My journey with TCM Security has been phenomenal. The information provided and the polish on the content is outstanding. 

A couple of weeks ago they had a special on most of their more popular courses for just a couple dollars each. I decided to snatch up 6 of these courses and I'm happy I did.

The courses I purchased are:

1. Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course
2. Practical Malware Analysis and Triage
3. Practical Web Application Security and Testing
4. Movement, Pivoting and Persistance
5. Mobile Application Penetration Testing
6. Linux 101

I'm about 30% through the PEH course and I can say that it's well worth the full price for it; if not more. Very well done.

That's it for my ramblings this evening!
